For Continuous
------------------------------------------------
  blueprint state: requirements
  - need to find an idea after transition has been applied
  - once the agent moves, there needs to be a room nearby


applyTransitions
------------------------------------------------
	Brainstorm what this should do
	it should apply aggainst the original (probably)
	Should it update the ideas directly?
	what about senses, should they update the ideas referenced by the subgraph?
	How do we reconcile "thoughs" vs "reality" if reality is overwritten?
		We can't blow up every time something is different; how will we ever imagine?
	What about thought experiments?
		Do we carve out sections of the idea graph? Duplicate sections? Or do we just add modified nodes and mark them as "thought experiment" knowing we have gotten too far from reality when too many of our nodes are alternates.
		Or do we save subgraphs as alternate worlds; we can save and load them whole-sale, otherwise we trudge on with our untainted world-thoughts.


hierarchy planning
------------------------------------------------
  I know I know this, but here is a practical use
  the wumpus takes forever to get from room a to room b
    approx p60/f100 in astar.search
  astar works by having a clear goal
    "go to room b" allows us to use "room b" as the target and then use manhattan distance as the primary progress count
    having a goal "exit" won't allow us to have any kind of intelligent distance
  so, we need to break the plan into parts
    1) get to the room with the gold
    2) grab
    3) get to the room with the exit
    3) exit
  but how do we make this generic?
  how do we know that grab/exit are the correct splits?

  Just something to think about
