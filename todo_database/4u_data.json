{"name":"Can we remove the discrete actuator definitions?","description":"this is more of a \"can we structure the new ones efficiently\" question\nif we can use a single set of actuators with sacrificing the performance that a discrete world provides, then we should do that\nwe can choose to register a subset of actuators (e.g. no fire/noop when it's not needed), but if \"turn left\" can be the same either way...\n\nI guess the hardest questions are:\n - how do we deal with the turn/forward velocity?","resolution":""}
