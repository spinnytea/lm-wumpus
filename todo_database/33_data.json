{"name":"Should types have categories?","description":"Statuses have categories (start, progress, end), but should types have them.\nThings like \"leaf\" or \"branch\". It's not like we should limit nesting (some tasks may need to be broken up or have child questions)\nWhat will this actually buy us? Types for status are for sorting and styling.\nWill we add more styling based on the task type?"}
