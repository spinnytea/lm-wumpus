{"name":"have/use post-process sensors","description":"this is just a first cut: the need to exist\nsort of like how we needed to hard code actuators before we could create the more generic stub\n\nThese only need to happen at the sensor level. The ideas that are created should be used internally like any other. If the agent room (derrived from agent loc x,y) is useful for planning, then it will be maintained by the actuators.\n\nThink of it paying attention to something. You don't always need to run the sensors, but your thoughts use them independently. If your thoughts require a particular sensor, then you may start paying attention to that thing ~ so we should mark ideas as derived, and which sensor is in charge of that. The sensor can come \"online\" when we need it.\n\nFor now, we can hard-code its necessity.","resolution":""}
