{"name":"Complex Sensor Actuator Relationships","description":"Imagine if you will:\nIf we put experience on actuators to learn how to use them.\nThere is a GPS Sensor, a Sonar sensor mounted to rotate, and Tank Style actuators.\n\nNow imagine a platform environment with an obstacle (you can run into the obstacle, you can fall off the edge).\n\nHow do you reliably update your GPS location?\nHow do you know when you can safely move forward?\nDoes it help if we fix the sensor (three at 0, 90 degrees)? (we'll know there is an obstacle in front, we'll know when we are next to a ledge)\nHow do we tease out the experience?"}
