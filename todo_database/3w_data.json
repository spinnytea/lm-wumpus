{"name":"Drawing Connections between Models","description":"This is another main point of my tool.\nLet's say we learn math, and we learn how to do a distance formula.\nWe do it the hard way by adding/multiplying/powers by hand, but we write a Math library, or just learn of it's existence.\n\nThen we have lm-wumpus with agent location, room location, and room size. We want to know if an agent is in a room.\n\nHow do we learn that the position of the agent acts like x-y cartesian coordinates? That we can use math against them to improve our sensor.\n\nI mean, \"do science during meditation\" is what I'm looking for, but that's an abstract how and when. I need something more concrete.","resolution":""}
