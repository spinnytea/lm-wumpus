{"name":"multiple databases","description":"each db gets it's own settings file\na \"running instance\" will configure which database it wants to connect to\nthe idea/proxy will need to store the db name - can we make this cleaner? maybe we create an ideas object constructor and each memory is configured to a db\n\nanyway, this way there can be multiple systems (i.e. experience can be in it's own db, tasks can be in it's own db, etc) without needing to reconfigure between runs (we would need a new way to manage unit tests)\nmaybe there's still a \"super folder\" where the tests live, and within that there are namespaced databases\nalso, we can link across them (links go in one direction) so experience can relate to a world model without cluttering it, and we can \"reset\" the experience when we are done with it (when we sleep)\neach database is for a \"functional core\"","resolution":""}
