{"name":"Hide Closed Tasks","description":"Hide the tasks that are closed from the task view.\nDoes this need a form element? Since I'm the only one use this, probably not.

It doesn't need to be in the active task list.\nIf we figure out how to handle filtering / multiple views, then we can come back. But his works for now."}
