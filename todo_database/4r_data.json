{"name":"Type Breakdown should exclude counts for tasks that are \"Done\"","description":"This is super meta, and therefore kind of hard.\nThe Type Breakdown keeps giving me \"false alarm\" with Defects/Impediments.\nI keep trying to look at the types and use it as a gauge for why my next \"round\" should be for; e.g. whether I should go for in progress, defects, or impediments.\n\nThat wasn't the original intent. It was really just meant for a loose idea of what kinds of tasks are in the system. But is that useful? Like how priority isn't included because it's so ephemeral. Then again, the main reason I started the counts was so I could have the task counts, to see the distribution.\n\nIt's just that the status counts are so informative beyond simple inquiry. And so I want the type counts to also have such value-add.\n\nYet, excluding \"done\" (status-category) is more complicated. I'll need to have filters implemented server side to query for \"all tasks of this type without this set of statuses\" and return the count instead of the list.","resolution":""}
