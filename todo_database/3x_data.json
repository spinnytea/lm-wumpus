{"name":"Required Config: How do we account for them?","description":"Right now, the only required config option is location, which will throw an error if you try to access it.\nWell, right now it's the only one, and it's pretty obvious because it's a major show stopper.\nWhat if there are others? How do we guarantee that all of them are overwritten?\n\nPossibility: we already demand location in a pretty visible manner, and we require config.init to be called. we have a list of all the required options and throw an error in init if one isn't provided.\n\nPossibility: start off with exports.data throwing new Error(\"you must call config.init\")","resolution":""}
