{"name":"Is this out of scope?","description":"LM is focusing on \"planning algorithms\" right now. Do we need to stick with this realm of logic?\nAre post-process sensors not using \"plans\" to come to conclusions?\n\"identify a room\" is not a planning based pattern. Sure, doing something fancy with a sensor to map to internal structures is a good thing, but I shouldn't lump it under patterns.","resolution":"I've thought about this enough to set it home.\nLM as it stands is focusing on automated planning.\nYes, my overall plan/method will apply to any kind of learning.\nThe database is a central part of the whole thing.\nBut Actions are about actions. Not sensors. And Recognizing Patterns within action data is not dependent on recognizing Patterns in sensor data. So for now, the sensors will live as-is, and we'll improve those at a later date."}
