{"name":"What will this affect?","parent":"2f","type":"1u","status":"7","description":"only leaves? will it deep search parents to see if nothing below them matches? or excluding parents (and thus ALL children) if a parent matches?\nonly the leaves is certainly enough for now; the recursing to children isn't something I want to do client side. excluding parent's is probably fine. I mostly want to \"remove everything that is done\" for starters, and so I'll bubble that up to parents when everything under them is done ~ Don't confuse filters with queries. if I want to see \"only things that are in progress\" then that'll be a query/list, not a filter","id":"2q"}
