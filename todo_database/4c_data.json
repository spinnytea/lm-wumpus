{"name":"evaluate unknown data","parent":"q","type":"9","status":"7","description":"Go back to astar and see how it works. the context doesn't match the goal specifically, but does it match it by type? I forget.\nHow do we determine that the goal can never be met? What parts of the goal are we missing?\nHow do we figure out the best way to reach the goal?\nDo the sensors add data that says \"explore here!\"\nArbitrary exploring isn't always good. In a game about checking rooms, you just check more rooms until you find something.\nIs our problem always going to be due to a lack of information? How does this play into a goal to matches by type, or does not match by type?","resolution":"","priority":"37","id":"4c"}
