{"name":"Future Test Cases","description":"Things to think about.\nGoals we have in mind.","resolution":"I don't yet want to record all the future test cases in my task backlog.\nThey aren't yet tasks; they are just grand ideas.\nThere is a place in the source (some notes files) for them, and they can live there just fine for now.\n\nBut here is a thought to plant in your mind: is this a limitation of the tool (an ability to NOT see them under normal conditions). Limitation due to small complexity, or because I want to avoid scope creep; doesn't matter. Is it because of the tool? OR is it because of the methodology? Right now, the backlog is for tasks to work on. Not really a GTD mentality, but a record of all the things that I intend to do. Dev that needs to happen. Something that I can pick up now, or will need to work towards. These \"future test cases\" would really be real-life applications of the tool. Great to keep in mind. But nnooottt really code dev tasks. lm-wumpus is a project because I AM working on it. these future test cases will all eventually be their own projects."}
